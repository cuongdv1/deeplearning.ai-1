# Binary Classification

In Machine Learning, there are two different types of algorithms. They are:

1. Regression Algorithm
2. Classification Algorithm



In **Regression Algorithm,** the target or the output is a continuous valued output where as in **Classification Algorithm**, the target is discrete. 

Through out this course, we will be looking at mainly Classification Algorithms. 

The most basic type of classification algorithms are the **Binary Classification Algorithms**. In Binary Classification algorithm, the output will have two discrete values. The discrete values may be text values, numbers, or Booleans.

A traditional example of Binary Classification algorithm is classifying images of cats and dogs. Another example can be classifying an email, as a spam or not spam email. 



We will be using Neural Networks to work on Binary Classification. 



The execution of Neural Networks takes place in two steps which are named as:

1. Forward Propagation
2. Backward Propagation



In **Forward Propagation**, the neural network moves forward over the complete data set once, and in **backward propagation**, the neural network moves back from the output to the input once. This two steps put together forms **one epoch**.



To implement Binary Classification, we will build an algorithm called as Logistic Regression



# Logistic Regression

Implementation of Logistic Regression mainly requires 3 different equations. These equations are generally called as:

1. Hypothesis Equation
2. Cost Function
3. Gradient Descent
